# Chatbot â€“ Artificial Brain

## Overview
This repository contains a lightweight chatbot demo built to run on commodity hardware. It is designed for experimentation with on-device AI tasks and demonstrates basic natural language understanding and response generation.

The project focuses on efficiency and usability rather than complex algorithms. It is intended as a **proof-of-concept for lightweight AI tools** that can run on low-power machines.



## Features
- Simple chat interface for user input and responses.
- Runs entirely on CPU, no GPU required.
- Lightweight dependencies for easy setup.
- Modular design for experimenting with tokenization or text preprocessing.

## Note:
- Current version is based on free tier API
